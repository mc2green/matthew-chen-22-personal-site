								<dt>Dear Reader</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>
										Since graduating from graduate school, I spent the last week getting started on my
										"New Years Resolutions" if you will (a whole week after New Years). I realized I needed
										more structure in my life now that I am job searching and learning new things, and what better
										way to give my self more time and structure in the day than to wake up with a revamped
										early morning routine. 
										<br><br>
										I've been gradually pushing my alarm back to 6:20am, and hope to push it back into the 5's 
										by the end of the month. Finger's crossed!
										<br><br>
										Furthermore, I have figured out what I need to be doing for the next couple of weeks,
										in terms of finding an opportunity and being prepared when opportunities do come. I've boiled
										it down to three main tasks: 
										
										<ol>
											<li style="margin-left: 22px;">Learning Java with my Java Masterclass course on Udemy.</li>
											<li style="margin-left: 22px;">Praciticing interview questions with HackerRank and Leetcode.</li>
											<li style="margin-left: 22px;">Searching for jobs on LinkedIn and Handshake.</li>
										</ol>
										
										Earlier this week, I had some issues with Heroku and Google Maps for my bootcamp apps and had been exchanging emails with their technical
										support team to get to issues worked out. I took a break after a couple days of troubleshooting to focus on my Java studies and job
										searching, but hopefully this weekend, I will give troubleshooting another go.
										<br><br>
										I also spent the first half of the week updating my resume, LinkedIn profile, and Handshake profile,
										and yesterday, I found some time to respond back to recruiters and apply to a couple of opportunities.
										Moreover, throughout this whole week, I have also been working through my Java Udemy course.
										I acknowledge don't have the perfect schedule carved out yet, but I will continue to find what feels right 
										and adjust my schedule in order to encompass all three essential tasks above while maintaining my well-being.
										
									
										<br><br>
										Well, that's all folks! Once again, hope everyone stays safe and warm during the middle of January.
